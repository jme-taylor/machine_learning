# machine_learning

A repository containing my efforts to learn machine learning theory, by coding the algorithms from scratch. For each algorithm, I intend to have some code that can be called, and a notebook with an explainer of this too.

## Models

|Model|Notebook|Code|
|-----|--------|----|
|Linear Regression|[Linear Regression Notebook](<https://github.com/jme-taylor/machine_learning/blob/main/nbs/linear_regression.ipynb>)|[Linear Regression Code](<https://github.com/jme-taylor/machine_learning/blob/main/machine_learning/linear_regression.py>)|

## To Do

Algorithms I'd like to cover (in a vague order):

* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Gradient Boosting
* K-nearest neighbours
* SVMs
* K-means clustering
* PCA
* Neural Networks
